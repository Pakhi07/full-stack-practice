        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, 
            and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Pasta was traditionally only 
            made with durum, although the definition has been expanded to include alternatives for a gluten-free diet, 
            such as rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils. Pasta is believed to have developed independently 
            in Italy and is a staple food of Italian cuisine, with evidence of Etruscans making pasta as early as 
            400 BCE in Italy.</p>

        <p>It is also commonly used to refer to the variety of pasta dishes. Typically, pasta is a noodle traditionally
            made from an unleavened dough of durum wheat flour mixed with water and formed into sheets or various shapes, 
            then cooked and served in any number of dishes. It can be made with flour from other cereals or grains, and 
            eggs may be used instead of water. Pastas may be divided into two broad categories, dried (pasta secca) and 
            fresh (pasta fresca).</p>

        <h2>Ingredients and Preparation</h2>

        <p>The traditional Italian pasta is made from durum wheat semolina, but other types of flour are used in other 
            parts of the world, such as rice flour in Southeast Asia, buckwheat flour in Japan, and mung bean starch in 
            China. The main ingredients of pasta are flour and water. Egg pasta includes eggs, while vegetable pasta 
            include vegetables. The preparation of pasta is simple and straightforward. The flour is mixed with water 
            and kneaded into a dough. The dough is then rolled out into thin sheets and cut into various shapes. The 
            pasta is then cooked in boiling water until it is done. The cooking time depends on the type of pasta and 
            the thickness of the dough.</p>
